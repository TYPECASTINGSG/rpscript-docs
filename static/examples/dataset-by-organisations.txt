      "description": "This Dataset shows the number of food shops by year. \r\n\r\nAll food retail establishments must be licensed in order to operate.  Each licence application is assessed on its own merits. Here is a self-checklist for easy reference on the requirements to fulfill.\r\n\r\nIn general, NEA will issue a foodshop licence when the following conditions are met with: \r\n\r\nCompliance with the Code of Practice of Environmental Health (COPEH) and operational requirements for foodshops, which covers areas like minimum kitchen size, refuse management, noise and cooking fumes control etc.  Please study the requirements appended. They will be verified through a pre-licensing check of the premises upon the completion of renovations and installation of equipment. \r\n Submission of relevant approvals and supporting documents \r\na. Approval from the land agency e.g. URA and HDB (referred to as planning permission from land agencies)* \r\nb. Tenancy agreement# \r\nc. Details of applicant - one of the following (where applicable): \r\n    i. Individual - Both sides of NRIC \r\n    ii. Company - Information Business Profile from Accounting & Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) \r\n    iii. Society - Certificate of Registration from Registrar of Societies \r\nd. Basic food hygiene certificate/Refresher food hygiene certificate of foodhandlers \r\ne. Food hygiene officer certificate (for Food caterers, Restaurants, Foodcourts and Canteens only) \r\nf. Cleaning program \r\ng. Layout plan of premises (in scaled metric units) \r\nh. Letter of authorisation (when submission of application is not done by intended licensee/director of company holding the licence) \r\ni. Pest control contract covering the control of rodents, cockroaches and flies during the year-long licensing period. The inspection frequency of the food shop premises covered in the contract shall be at least once a month to detect any sign of pest infestation. \r\nj. Supplementary Information form to capture business name, type of food sold, business operating hours, etc. \r\nk. Food Safety Management Plan (with critical control points identified) or proof of registration for the “WSQ Apply FSMS for Food Service Establishments” course. (For Food Caterers only). Refer to the following link for more details. \r\nl. Photos showing the interior and exterior of the catering vehicle \r\nm. Vehicle log card or tenancy agreement for rental vehicle to prove ownership of catering vehicle \r\nn. Cleaning program for catering vehicle\r\n*Please note that this is potential pitfall for applicant. Applicant should ensure the relevant planning permission is obtained, prior to signing any tenancy agreement and investing in renovations/equipment for the premises. \r\n\r\nPlease notes that the submission of a tenancy agreement is not required during the initial stage of application for a licence. The tenancy agreement will only be required at the final stage, before NEA approves and issues the licence. You are advised not to sign any tenancy agreement, until the land agency concerned has approved the relevant use for the premises, and you are reasonably confident you can meet with the COPEH requirements by also verifying with the owner/landlord on the necessary renovations like installation of exhaust system, pipings for sinks etc.",

      "description": "The annual rates are the simple average of the quarterly rates of re-entry into employment which show the rates of re-entry into employment in a quarter for residents retrenched six months ago.\r\n\r\nBefore 2007, data refer to the proportion of residents on permanent employment who were retrenched by private sector establishments (each with at least 25 employees) and re-entered employment six months after retrenchment. From 2007 onwards, data also include the proportion of residents retrenched by the public sector. ​From 2010, the coverage is further expanded to include residents on term contracts which were terminated prematurely because of redundancy.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that data on re-entry into employment are cohort-specific. Two different cohorts of workers laid off could yield a different re-entry rate depending on the profile of the workers involved. Also, the data based on CPF records do not capture workers who enter into self or informal employment or undergo training while looking for job.",

      "description": "The Graduate Employment Survey (GES) is jointly conducted by NTU, NUS, SMU, SIT (from 2014) and SUTD (from 2015) annually to survey the employment conditions of graduates about six months after their final examinations.  The Ministry of Education (MOE) publishes the results of key employment indicators of the survey to provide prospective students with timely and comparable data to assist them in making informed course decisions.  Graduates from NTU, NUS and SMU were surveyed in Nov.  Due to their different academic calendars, graduates from SUTD and SIT were surveyed in Feb and Mar.\r\n\r\n2015 GES:  \r\n\r\n  *  5,774 graduates from NTU were surveyed and the overall response rate obtained was 71.9%.  \r\n  *  6,188 graduates from NUS were surveyed and the overall response rate obtained was 74.8%.  \r\n  * 1,638 graduates from SMU were surveyed and the overall response rate obtained was 76.2%.  \r\n  * 298 graduates from SUTD were surveyed and the overall response rate was 86.2%.\r\n\r\n2014 GES:  14,868 graduates from NTU, NUS, SIT and SMU were surveyed and the overall response rate obtained was 75%.\r\n\r\n2013 GES:  15,365 graduates from NTU, NUS and SMU were surveyed and the overall response rate obtained was 72%. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe employment rates refer to the number of graduates employed as a proportion of economically active graduates (i.e. graduates who engage actively in the labour market either by working or looking for a job) approximately 6 months after completing their final examinations.\r\n\r\nBasic monthly salary pertains only to full-time permanently employed graduates.  It comprises basic pay before deductions of the employee’s CPF contributions and personal income tax.  Employer’s CPF contributions, bonuses, stock options, overtime payments, commissions, allowances, other monetary and lump sum payments, and payments-in-kind are excluded.\r\n\r\nGross monthly salary pertains only to full-time permanently employed graduates.  It comprises the basic salary, fixed allowances, over-time pay and commissions, before deductions of the employee’s CPF contributions and personal income tax.  Employer’s CPF contributions, bonuses, stock options, other lump sum payments, and payments-in-kind are excluded.\r\n\r\n\\*  SMU's courses are direct 4-yr programmes and graduates could be awarded Cum Laude and above, Merit, High Merit or no awards.  The data for SMU's courses is displayed in two categories: (i) overall results for all graduates within the course regardless of the award they attained, and (ii) results for the graduates awarded Cum Laude and above.  Should the graduates undertake more than 1 Degree (e.g. Dual Degree programme), they have been classified based on their first Degree.\r\n\r\n\\#  National Institute of Education (NIE) is an autonomous institute of NTU.\r\n\r\n^  Data on Biomedical Sciences (Traditional Chinese Medicine) graduates is obtained from a follow-up survey on those who graduated 1 year ago (e.g. for 2015 GES survey, data is obtained from 2014 graduates) after they have completed their practical training.\r\n\r\n\\**  No data is shown due to the small number of graduates and/or low response rates.\r\n\r\n\\##  Data on law, medical and pharmacy graduates are obtained from a follow-up survey on those who graduated 1 year ago (e.g. for 2015 GES survey, data is obtained from 2014 graduates) after they have completed their 1-year practical law course/pupillage/housemanship/first-year residency.  Data on architecture graduates are obtained from a follow-up survey on those who graduated 3 years ago (e.g. for 2015 GES survey, data is obtained from 2012 graduates) after they have completed their practical training.\r\n\r\n^^  Data includes the employment figures of graduates from Bachelor of Engineering (Bioengineering), which was merged into Bachelor of Engineering (Biomedical Engineering) in 2014.\r\n\r\n@@  The Bachelor of Environmental Studies is a multidisciplinary programme that allows graduates to specialise in either Environmental Biology within the Faculty of Science, or Environmental Geography within the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. \r\n\r\n++  Data on law graduates are obtained from a follow-up survey on those who graduated 1 year ago (e.g. for 2015 GES survey, data is obtained from 2014 graduates) after they have completed their practical law course/pupillage.\r\n\r\n\\###  Data on Bachelor of Science (Architecture and Sustainable Design) graduates will be obtained from a follow-up survey on the graduates after they have completed their practical training. \r\n    \r\n    \r\nDisclaimer:  \r\nThe data published is provided on an “as is” basis without any warranties of any kind.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, MOE does not warrant and hereby disclaims any warranty as to the accuracy, correctness, completeness, reliability or fitness for any particular purpose of such data.  The reader assumes all responsibility and risk for the use of such data.  MOE shall not be liable for any damage or loss of any kind caused as a result (directly or indirectly) of the use of such data, including but not limited to any damage or loss suffered as a result of reliance on the data published.",

It should clearly describe the extent of disability (e.g. temporary, permanent) and the type of assistive device that the child is currently using (e.g. wheelchair, crutches).\r\n  * Mild SEN - A comprehensive report written by a relevant professional (e.g. psychologist, speech and language therapist). It should indicate the nature of the disability with supporting evidence for the diagnosis and provide clear description of the student’s current functioning and limitations, together with recommendations for support and intervention. Other documents may include a school report from the student’s primary school providing additional background to his/her condition and any other relevant documents. MOE will consider appeals for transfer to a school resourced to support mild SEN only if that school is included as one of the student’s original choice of secondary schools.",
