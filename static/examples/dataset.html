Prior to Aug 2012, taxi operators can bid for a new COE or pay Prevailing Quota Premium (PQP) to register a taxi under Category A.  The latter is only in the case of a new taxi that replaces a deregistered one within 6 months.  From 6 Aug 2012 onwards, all taxis pay for COEs based on the PQP of Category A.	

ETS stands for Early Turnover Scheme.  Between 24 Apr 2013 and 30 Apr 2016, vehicle owners can de-register their existing diesel-propelled Category C vehicles that were registered before 1 Jan 2001 and register a replacement vehicle within 1 month of de-registration by paying a discounted Prevailing Quota Premium (PQP) under the ETS.  From 1 Aug 2015, the ETS was extended to existing diesel-propelled Category C vehicles that were registered between 1 Jan 2001 and 30 Sep 2006 and will be de-registered between 1 Aug 2015 and 31 Jul 2017.

Vehicles exempted from the VQS include scheduled and school buses, emergency vehicles, engineering plants primarily for off-the-road use, diplomatic vehicles and vehicles under the Disabled Person Scheme.

Cars registered with COEs obtained from the Feb 2014 1st bidding exercise onwards:

* Category A: Cars up to 1600cc and 97kW
* Category B: Cars above 1600cc or 97kW

Cars registered with COEs obtained before Feb 2014 bidding exercises:

Age-Standardised Death Rate is a summary indicator of mortality that removes the effects of age structure variations in population composition. It is computed by multiplying the age-specific death rates of the reference population by the proportion of the corresponding age group out of a “standard” population. The Singapore resident population as at June 2003 is used as the standard population which is chosen to fix the age structure to eliminate its effect on mortality trends.

1) The channelling of Primary 3 students into Primary 4 Normal, Extended and Monolingual streams was replaced in 1992 by channelling at Primary 4 into      Primary 5 EM1, EM2 and EM3 streams.
2) Total primary enrolment includes Primary 7 and Primary 8 students from the Extended and Monolingual streams.
3) Since 2004, the distinction between the EM1 and EM2 streams have been removed and schools were given the autonomy to decide on how best to band their students by ability, in ways that added the most educational value. Since 2008, Subject-based Banding was introduced for the Primary 5 cohort and streaming was removed. With Subject-based Banding, students are able to offer a mix of Standard or Foundation level subjects depending on their aptitude in each subject.</td>

                        <td>The Graduate Employment Survey (GES) is jointly conducted by NTU, NUS, SMU, SIT (from 2014) and SUTD (from 2015) annually to survey the employment conditions of graduates about six months after their final examinations.  The Ministry of Education (MOE) publishes the results of key employment indicators of the survey to provide prospective students with timely and comparable data to assist them in making informed course decisions.  Graduates from NTU, NUS and SMU were surveyed in Nov.  Due to their different academic calendars, graduates from SUTD and SIT were surveyed in Feb and Mar.

2015 GES:  

  *  5,774 graduates from NTU were surveyed and the overall response rate obtained was 71.9%.  
  *  6,188 graduates from NUS were surveyed and the overall response rate obtained was 74.8%.  
  * 1,638 graduates from SMU were surveyed and the overall response rate obtained was 76.2%.  
  * 298 graduates from SUTD were surveyed and the overall response rate was 86.2%.

2014 GES:  14,868 graduates from NTU, NUS, SIT and SMU were surveyed and the overall response rate obtained was 75%.

2013 GES:  15,365 graduates from NTU, NUS and SMU were surveyed and the overall response rate obtained was 72%. 

Notes:

The employment rates refer to the number of graduates employed as a proportion of economically active graduates (i.e. graduates who engage actively in the labour market either by working or looking for a job) approximately 6 months after completing their final examinations.

Basic monthly salary pertains only to full-time permanently employed graduates.  It comprises basic pay before deductions of the employee’s CPF contributions and personal income tax.  Employer’s CPF contributions, bonuses, stock options, overtime payments, commissions, allowances, other monetary and lump sum payments, and payments-in-kind are excluded.

Gross monthly salary pertains only to full-time permanently employed graduates.  It comprises the basic salary, fixed allowances, over-time pay and commissions, before deductions of the employee’s CPF contributions and personal income tax.  Employer’s CPF contributions, bonuses, stock options, other lump sum payments, and payments-in-kind are excluded.

\*  SMU&#39;s courses are direct 4-yr programmes and graduates could be awarded Cum Laude and above, Merit, High Merit or no awards.  The data for SMU&#39;s courses is displayed in two categories: (i) overall results for all graduates within the course regardless of the award they attained, and (ii) results for the graduates awarded Cum Laude and above.  Should the graduates undertake more than 1 Degree (e.g. Dual Degree programme), they have been classified based on their first Degree.

^  Data on Biomedical Sciences (Traditional Chinese Medicine) graduates is obtained from a follow-up survey on those who graduated 1 year ago (e.g. for 2015 GES survey, data is obtained from 2014 graduates) after they have completed their practical training.

\**  No data is shown due to the small number of graduates and/or low response rates.

\##  Data on law, medical and pharmacy graduates are obtained from a follow-up survey on those who graduated 1 year ago (e.g. for 2015 GES survey, data is obtained from 2014 graduates) after they have completed their 1-year practical law course/pupillage/housemanship/first-year residency.  Data on architecture graduates are obtained from a follow-up survey on those who graduated 3 years ago (e.g. for 2015 GES survey, data is obtained from 2012 graduates) after they have completed their practical training.

^^  Data includes the employment figures of graduates from Bachelor of Engineering (Bioengineering), which was merged into Bachelor of Engineering (Biomedical Engineering) in 2014.

The index is based on quarterly average resale price by date of registration. The index till 3Q2014 was computed using stratification method, while that from 4Q2014 onwards is computed using the stratified hedonic regression method. 1Q2009 is adopted as the new base period with index at 100. The index from 1Q1990 to 3Q2014 are rebased to the new base period at 1Q2009. Indices from 
1Q1990 to 3Q2014 are re-scaled using a factor of 100 (new index in 1Q2009) / 138.3 (original index in 1Q2009) multiplied on the original index level to derive the re-based index level for the respective quarters. Due to rounding, there could be some differences in the quarterly price change compared to the RPI series before re-scaling.</td>

Job Vacancy refers to the number of unfilled posts for which an establishment is actively recruiting employees from outside the establishment.  They exclude

a)	Positions for which the employees have been appointed, but have not yet commenced duty;

b)	Positions open only to internal transfers, promotion.

Recruitment action to fill a post includes advertising in newspapers, posting notices on the internet (e.g. on online job banks), making word-of-mouth announcements, soliciting employees through employment agencies or job fairs, contacting or interviewing registered job applicants.

Before 2006, data on job vacancies pertain to private sector establishments each with at least 25 employees. From 2006 onwards, data also include the public sector. A new methodology was also introduced in Q1 2010 to improve the estimation of job vacancies. Data spanning back to 2006 have been revised using this methodology.</td>

a)	Positions for which the employees have been appointed, but have not yet commenced duty;

b)	Positions open only to internal transfers, promotion.

Recruitment action to fill a post includes advertising in newspapers, posting notices on the internet (e.g. on online job banks), making word-of-mouth announcements, soliciting employees through employment agencies or job fairs, contacting or interviewing registered job applicants.

Before 2006, data on job vacancies pertain to private sector establishments each with at least 25 employees. From 2006 onwards, data also include the public sector. A new methodology was also introduced in Q1 2010 to improve the estimation of job vacancies. Data spanning back to 2006 have been revised using this methodology.</td>

All food retail establishments must be licensed in order to operate.  Each licence application is assessed on its own merits. Here is a self-checklist for easy reference on the requirements to fulfill.

In general, NEA will issue a foodshop licence when the following conditions are met with: 

Compliance with the Code of Practice of Environmental Health (COPEH) and operational requirements for foodshops, which covers areas like minimum kitchen size, refuse management, noise and cooking fumes control etc.  Please study the requirements appended. They will be verified through a pre-licensing check of the premises upon the completion of renovations and installation of equipment. 
 Submission of relevant approvals and supporting documents 
a. Approval from the land agency e.g. URA and HDB (referred to as planning permission from land agencies)* 
b. Tenancy agreement# 
c. Details of applicant - one of the following (where applicable): 
    i. Individual - Both sides of NRIC 
    ii. Company - Information Business Profile from Accounting &amp; Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) 
    iii. Society - Certificate of Registration from Registrar of Societies 
d. Basic food hygiene certificate/Refresher food hygiene certificate of foodhandlers 
e. Food hygiene officer certificate (for Food caterers, Restaurants, Foodcourts and Canteens only) 
f. Cleaning program 
g. Layout plan of premises (in scaled metric units) 
h. Letter of authorisation (when submission of application is not done by intended licensee/director of company holding the licence) 
i. Pest control contract covering the control of rodents, cockroaches and flies during the year-long licensing period. The inspection frequency of the food shop premises covered in the contract shall be at least once a month to detect any sign of pest infestation. 
j. Supplementary Information form to capture business name, type of food sold, business operating hours, etc. 
k. Food Safety Management Plan (with critical control points identified) or proof of registration for the “WSQ Apply FSMS for Food Service Establishments” course. (For Food Caterers only). Refer to the following link for more details. 
l. Photos showing the interior and exterior of the catering vehicle 
m. Vehicle log card or tenancy agreement for rental vehicle to prove ownership of catering vehicle 
n. Cleaning program for catering vehicle
*Please note that this is potential pitfall for applicant. Applicant should ensure the relevant planning permission is obtained, prior to signing any tenancy agreement and investing in renovations/equipment for the premises. 

Please notes that the submission of a tenancy agreement is not required during the initial stage of application for a licence. The tenancy agreement will only be required at the final stage, before NEA approves and issues the licence. You are advised not to sign any tenancy agreement, until the land agency concerned has approved the relevant use for the premises, and you are reasonably confident you can meet with the COPEH requirements by also verifying with the owner/landlord on the necessary renovations like installation of exhaust system, pipings for sinks etc.</td>

Singapore Infopedia is an electronic encyclopedia on Singapore published by the National Library Board (NLB). It holds a collection of articles on Singapore and covers a wide range of topics, including but not limited to historical events, arts, culture, economy, government and key personalities. The number of articles continues to grow as new entries are added regularly.

The articles are written for the general reader, including students, with each article providing an overview of the topic. However, every article is accompanied by references that may be used to research the topic further. Related images in selected articles and cross-referencing between related articles help to create a more complete understanding of a particular topic.

All entries are based on verifiable, authoritative sources and are accurate as far as we are able to ascertain at the time of publication. The articles present information objectively and do not contain the writer&#39;s or the editor&#39;s personal experiences or opinions.</td>

Usually, there is a breakdown in the relationship and communication between the child/young person and his/her parent/s. It may result in the inability of the parent/s to exercise care and control over the child/young person. In these circumstances, the parent/s can apply to the Youth Court for a BPC order.
 
In filing a BPC complaint*, the parent/s and the child/young person may be put through a diversionary programme such as pre-complaint mediation. This is a  measure to minimise the child/young person’s exposure to the judicial system. Should such diversionary measures fail, the Youth Court can place the child/young person on Statutory Supervision or admit him/her into a residential facility for those who display very high risk behaviours.

The count refers to the cases by gender annually.

*BPC complaint refers to a situation where the parents had filled a BPC concerning the child but is pending court&#39;s decision. A BPC case refers to a situation where court has issued a BPC order concerning the child.</td>

Data on New Sale are final and will not be revised as they are compiled based on returns from licensed developers. Data on the number of Sub-sale and Resale units excludes en-bloc sale units and are collated from records submitted to Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore for stamp duty payments from 1Q2015. Prior to 1Q2015, Sub-sale and Resale data were compiled from caveats lodged to the Singapore Land Authority. As the latter (i.e. lodgment of caveats) is voluntary, caveats account for about 80 to 90% of all sub-sale and resale transactions. Hence, please note that data from 1Q2015 may not be directly comparable to figures in the previous quarters.</td>

                        <td>The (intramural) R&amp;D expenditures for an organisation comprise all expenditures on R&amp;D
performed within the organisation during the reporting period. They include expenditures made outside the organisation but in support of the R&amp;D performed within the organisation. It excludes extramural R&amp;D expenditures, which are the sums an organisation paid or committed to pay to another organisation for the performance of R&amp;D, where the latter includes acquisition of R&amp;D performed by others and grants given to others for performing R&amp;D.

Intramural R&amp;D expenditures comprises capital expenditures, manpower expenditures and other operating expenditures

Capital expenditures are the annual gross expenditures on fixed assets used in the R&amp;D
programmes of the organisation, i.e. on (i) land, buildings and other structures, and on (ii)
vehicles, plant, machinery and equipment. They are reported in full for the reporting period
when they took place rather than registered as an element of depreciation.

Manpower expenditures comprise annual wages and salaries and all associated expenditures for R&amp;D manpower. The manpower expenditures on persons who provide an indirect service to R&amp;D and are not categorized as R&amp;D manpower are
included as other operating expenditures on R&amp;D and not as manpower expenditures on R&amp;D.

Other operating expenditures include noncapital purchases of materials, supplies and equipment to support R&amp;D performed by the organisation. Administrative and other overhead expenditures are included and prorated if necessary. Expenditures on indirect services are included. Rents and fees associated with R&amp;D are included.

One full-time equivalence (FTE) unit may be thought of as one person-year. A person who spends 30% of his time on R&amp;D and the rest on other activities during the one-year reporting period should be considered as 0.3 FTE. If a fulltime R&amp;D worker is employed for only six months during the one year reporting period, this results in a 0.5 FTE

R&amp;D manpower comprises the three occupation groups defined and described below: researchers; technicians; and other supporting staff. Researchers are further sub-classified as follows:

* Research scientists and engineers (RSEs) comprise the researchers, excluding the fulltime postgraduate research students, who hold formal qualifications at the university degree level. RSEs are classified into three subcategories according to the highest level of the formal qualifications: PhD; master degree; and bachelor degree.

* Non-degree researchers comprise the researchers, excluding the full-time postgraduate research students, who hold formal qualifications below the university degree level.

* Full-time postgraduate research students (FPGRSs).

Notes:

The table lists the schools that are resourced with the following facilities, programmes and/or specialised staff to support their students with the respective special needs:

  * Integration programmes for students with Hearing Loss (HL) who use the Signing or Oral Approach as modes of communication
  * Integration programmes for Visually Impaired (VI) students
  * Full handicapped facilities for students with Physical Disabilities (PD)
  * Allied Educators (Learning &amp; Behavioural Support) to complement the support that classroom teachers presently provide to students with mild Special Educational Needs (Mild SEN)

Students with PD or mild SEN who are not posted to an appropriate-resourced school listed in the table may apply for a transfer. Such students should first report at the secondary school that they were posted to on the next working day after the release of posting results, and apply for school transfer there. All applications must be accompanied with the relevant supporting documents, as follows:

  * PD - An assessment of the student’s condition and needs from a qualified medical professional. It should clearly describe the extent of disability (e.g. temporary, permanent) and the type of assistive device that the child is currently using (e.g. wheelchair, crutches).
  * Mild SEN - A comprehensive report written by a relevant professional (e.g. psychologist, speech and language therapist). It should indicate the nature of the disability with supporting evidence for the diagnosis and provide clear description of the student’s current functioning and limitations, together with recommendations for support and intervention. Other documents may include a school report from the student’s primary school providing additional background to his/her condition and any other relevant documents. MOE will consider appeals for transfer to a school resourced to support mild SEN only if that school is included as one of the student’s original choice of secondary schools.</td>

A household is defined as an entire group of persons, who may or may not be
related, living together in a housing unit. There may also be one-person
households, where a person lives alone in a single housing unit. The household
is equated with the housing unit and there is usually one household per housing
unit. Subtenants or maids dwelling in the same housing unit as the lessee(s) or
registered tenant(s) do not constitute part of the household.

Type of Family Nucleus:

* Nuclear family refers to either:
  (i) a married couple with or without children; or
  (ii) a family consisting of immediate related members, without the presence of a married couple, e.g. one parent only with unmarried child or children.
* Extended nuclear family comprises a nuclear family with one or more relatives who, by themselves, do not form a nuclear family.
* Multi-nuclear family refers to a family comprising two or more nuclear families.
* Non-family based households refer to:
  (i) single-person households (a person living alone who could be single,
widowed or divorced); or
  (ii) unrelated or distantly related persons staying together.</td>
